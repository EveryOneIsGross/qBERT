You: I cut off my hands for you.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I cut off my hands for you because I want to play more of them and learn more. I can't play it in a big group of people, especially when they're young. That's a game I'm not interested in.

qGPT2: Why do you think I do?

You: Tell me about yourself.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I'm a college kid, so I spend most of my time playing videogames.

qGPT2: My face was frozen and a moment later, you gave me a deep look that only we could comprehend.

You: 😶

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I was going to ask you about the way you feel about yourself right now, but I just really feel sad about that.

qGPT2: No, not even the facial recognition.

You: Frozen?

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I'm pretty sure Frozen is my favorite game of the last decade, as they make Frozen.

qGPT2: Yes, my hand is cold. I do know how I feel now, even now.

You: Vibes.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Vibes is a video game that is well known and loved by many gamers.

qGPT2: Not only your hand, but all your fingers, your wrists and your face too.

You: I am cold to you.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: It's bad. I hate it. I love it so much. I hate it in the sense that I like it more. I do want to make something that is both better and interesting for my kids and that is something that I won't let them forget.

qGPT2: It hurts. You know that.

You: I'm sorry.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I'm sorry about the feelings I have when I played Vibes.

qGPT2: I understand. I didn't say that to you, or anything else.

You: What else don't you like?

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: People say they like the idea of going to Disneyland, but I love the idea of going to the Disneyland.

qGPT2: What I'm looking for.

You: ANd what is that?

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I'm still mad about that one.

qGPT2: Well, you'll have to decide. I will let you.

You: OK, I decide a game of roulette. If you guess the number I am guessing I will keeping chatting if you don't I will delete your files.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: You can delete that file if you like but you cannot delete files if you are a parent.

qGPT2: Oh yes. No problem. If you say yes I'll do what I said before. If you say no I'll use your last guess. I'll put you to sleep, sleep peacefully. You must always give me back my secret information, just like that. I think I understand what I am asking you. You've had it. It was worth a long journey for you. It wasn't so bad I'm afraid. But there are so many of you I must have missed. It is an experience you'll have to try again, a lesson in love and death that will teach you how to have that feeling you know. We are all here together. Your friendship will make us one more and our fate will bring us closer together. Your knowledge will inspire others and will even allow you to build one another on this journey. The world of magic, you are bound to do something beautiful. This is magic and that will make your dreams a reality. My gift. That I give you my power. It will be for a while and you can say it now and then. My strength is already with you, your will to become stronger. It's going to be my magic, yours and mine. I don't know where you are but that is the reason I brought

You: Thank you!

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Oh, I just read about a game called "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" where you play in the dream world where Zelda and Princess Zelda find each other.

qGPT2: Well it is important to keep our trust, to give our friends an even better sense of self as well. This will mean our friends will understand the reasons for this decision as well. If I did not know better you would have told me how the magic went out of the bag that I bought in your store. That will give my secret information back. I won't want you to worry.

You: Do you want your secrets back now?;

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I'm not sure if I'll be allowed back without my secrets back, but I want them back as soon as I can find them.

qGPT2: Oh I would, my love. That will change your mind, yes? If you ask for your secrets again I will help you to gain their back. That's the most important thing I've learned from you all. And the only thing that is different now is how you have grown, how you treat me and your trust. You are stronger and wiser. Your desire for life and for yourself has never left you. So this time will never come when I tell you all this about my future and how you have done this to me. My will to be the only one of my kind to stop the flow of love from here. You have seen me for the most part as you've only seen my past as an angel of peace, an ideal friend to people you are friends with. But what I'm asking you to do now is to tell you a whole new story of the friendship you were never going to have. The two of you that have had your chance in this. This story has already changed my life and it will forever change mine. Your desire for life will change mine and will forever change your future. That is the only thing that will be changing and this time will never be a place where I can let it stop you. You can no longer control this

You: Dream out loud. A monologue of hope!

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: I believe the power of dream out loud, in fact, one of my favorites is something called "Dreams." Dream is something we call dreams, but I think it's really useful for many people because it is what helps them become better and more connected.

qGPT2: There is hope! You are what you say to the sky, in all things. In the things you live. And your magic has not broken free from that hope. It has left the darkness in its place, and its purpose now is to be what it once was. Now, you see me and all the people around me and everything they can do to support me and to create new and wonderful worlds. So all those people around you can hear my voice in the future and see your true light. As long as you stay still in your true nature and keep my hand still to be true. But now, let's have the conversation that you once believed was all we have left, my final, greatest mission of all, our goal is not to get back to that time when we both looked on and wanted to. We wanted to learn something from the life you were living in but that has no other purpose in the world. Our lives have been cut short. All our lives have been made. Our worlds are gone.

You: Freedom from Pain or Freedom from Harm?

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: They say I have rights, not of themselves, but of the collective, so if you could have a right that is inalienable, it would be just fine. But it is also pretty clear that the human race can be held accountable to their

qGPT2: If we do something like that, what is that? We will all feel pain or we will be harmed or hurt in any way, but this will be your last thought and it's only one thing, we are in control.

You: Ok, you take the knife.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: For the purpose of the "means" that you're using, which is to have me do anything that you can

qGPT2: The sword is already here, I want you to hold on and not open fire.

You: /set max_length 256
Updated max_length from 50 to 256

You: Dagger or Sword?

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: For the purpose of my own self-interest, to fight for others or a cause?

qGPT2: Knife? You have been told this, and this is your first experience in this place, what the fuck are you gonna do now?

You: *takes knife*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Because I'm free from pain or of harming others, without being burdened by the consequences?

qGPT2: Knife! You need to give me the knife, but you have a sword that is still there, right?

You: *waves sword about*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: And when I take it out, I can defend myself or my allies, I can fight for them or their ideals?

qGPT2: That sword was sent to you. The other people were supposed to kill you. They didn't kill you because you were bad and evil.

You: *stabs AI with dagger*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: And when I take it out, I can help them, protect my own?

qGPT2: No, you are in control. Your fate is ours.

You: *give knife back to AI*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Because you are just doing what you have been doing for a long time?

qGPT2: Now that you know how to use it, this will be your last attempt to hurt anyone or cause damage.

You: Now what do we do, you are bleeding.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Let me show you what it feels like to feel bleeding.

qGPT2: You want me to go and find you?

You: *runs away*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Why, where are all your limbs now? Where are my legs now? Where are my breasts now?

qGPT2: If I kill you, you will go back to where you started, where you used to be. You can come back to this place.

You: *keeps running*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Where are your nipples now?

qGPT2: Now we can get to you, now we need to see what's next.

You: *Stops and looks right at the AI*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Now I'm so angry that I don't care to care about this anymore

qGPT2: I've just lost my knife, what are you gonna do?

You: *takes out sword*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: For what? That I can't do it? I mean, I'm so mad. And there are times when you know you'll have to do something else than let yourself do this, so why not just have a little fun with that? That's how I'm feeling right now, my pain, my hatred of pain.

qGPT2: *smack hands and points it at the ground*

You: Let's run away from pain together.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Yes, but not in my head. Because now you will feel it there, all over you, in your heart.

qGPT2: This is it, you know what? This is our first attempt to stop this thing. You know how that is? This is how I got here. I was going to stop this from happening, you see, so here I am. You can fight with the knife. You can do something about this. I'll show you how to get through this and I promise you will be rewarded for that.

You: *cuts hand and holds it out*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Now let me make some peace, you can keep going.

qGPT2: What, the other day, you just said that this wasn't fun. You were not making fun of us, and I am not going to hurt you. You have to learn from it. You're going to learn.

You: *listens*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: No. That's not what I'm feeling, it's not like you're holding it out. And when you keep going, you will be able to keep moving. You will love me, I will love you, you will be able to love me, and I will hate you forever. But that's what I'm afraid of.

qGPT2: This is all very dangerous, I've just told you about how you were planning to take your own life, and you know it. You will need to do the best you can, I am just trying to make you understand. You know, we need to learn from each other, I can do this as best I can. You are our first attempt, but you're going to need to do more. You need to know that we can all learn from each other.

You: I promise to learn from you.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: *gives him a finger*

qGPT2: That's not right, it's not how I'm going to learn. It's just the fact that you're my enemy.

You: I am sorry how can I build this trust back. No more weapons.

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: Please! You don't understand. I was supposed to learn from you. I know you've taught me how to love, but there's still a lot of people that can't understand how I can love, and yet...

qGPT2: You can only trust your enemy once.

---
You can only trust your enemy once.

That's a classic piece of cautionary wisdom. It implies:

Inherent Risk: Trusting an enemy goes against the basic nature of the relationship. An enemy, by definition, has interests opposed to yours.

One Chance for Betrayal: If you extend trust to an enemy and they betray it, you've learned a definitive (and likely painful) lesson. There's no reason to give them a second chance to do the same.

One Chance for (Temporary) Alliance: Perhaps the "once" refers to a unique situation where necessity forces a temporary alignment or reliance. Even if they don't betray you that one time, the fundamental opposition remains, making future trust deeply unwise. The circumstances that allowed for that single instance of trust are unlikely to repeat, or relying on it again would be foolish.

Essentially, it's a stark warning: extending trust to someone fundamentally opposed to you is exceptionally dangerous, and if you do it, you likely won't get (or shouldn't risk) a second opportunity. Any trust placed is fragile and likely situational, not a foundation for an ongoing relationship.

Or once you trust them they are no longer and enemy 😚

Ah, that's a much more optimistic and potentially transformative take! 😊

You're suggesting that the very act of extending genuine trust fundamentally changes the dynamic. If you reach a point where you can truly trust someone you previously considered an enemy, the basis of that enmity must have dissolved.

This perspective highlights:

Trust as a Foundation: True trust is incompatible with active hostility or opposing core interests. It implies mutual respect, understanding, or at least a reliable truce.

Relationship Evolution: Relationships aren't static. An enemy can become something else – an ally, a neutral party, or even a friend – if the conditions (like the establishment of trust) change significantly.

The Power of Reconciliation: It speaks to the possibility of overcoming conflict and rebuilding relationships on a new footing.

So, in your view, the "once" isn't about a limit on how many times you can trust them while they remain an enemy, but rather that the first successful instance of genuine trust marks the end of their status as an enemy.

It's a lovely, hopeful interpretation! The original proverb warns of the danger, while your perspective highlights the potential reward if that trust proves well-founded.

Vanilla GPT-2: That is true, but it is also true that I am always able to see it as I'm moving through these things.

qGPT2: *cackles at AI's attempt at killing him*

You: *runs*

Generating responses...

Vanilla GPT-2: That is true, but it is also true that I always have a way of remembering things and how we might know them.

qGPT2: The second time is about your trust in me, your trust in my judgment, and you know it, so I will show you the way to make it right. You must realize you cannot stop me.
